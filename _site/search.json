    "text": "Title\n\n\nIntroduction to Question 1\nThis part investigates the historical trends in temperature anomalies across various latitudinal zones from 1880 to the present, utilizing the GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP v4) dataset. The analysis focuses on the deviation of temperatures from the 1951-1980 mean, offering insights into climate behavior over time. Our interest lies in understanding how temperature variations are distributed across the planet and discerning patterns that could indicate broader climate trends. By examining both hemispheres and various latitudinal zones, we aim to reveal differential impacts of climate change across the globe. This analysis is particularly pertinent given the growing concerns regarding global warming and its disparate effects on different regions of the Earth.\n\n\nApproach\nThe approach for this analysis will involve two distinct methods: heatmap visualization and time series analysis. The heatmap provides an intuitive grasp of the data by color mapping the temperature anomalies across latitudinal zones over time. This method is suitable for spotting overall trends and outliers in a comprehensive visual format. For the time series analysis, we will examine the changes in global and hemispheric mean temperatures over time. This will involve plotting the data, with a particular emphasis on trend lines to discern long-term changes. The use of color mapping in the heatmap serves to quickly convey the magnitude of anomalies, while the time series plot with its trend line will enable us to evaluate the trajectory of temperature changes more formally.\n\n\nAnalysis\nBelow are just template for us to structure our code blocks for the Analysis section.\n\n\nCode Block 1: Load and preprocess the data\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Load the dataset, will add path \ndata = pd.read_csv('')\n\n# Data preprocessing steps\n\ndata.fillna(data.mean(), inplace=True)\n\n\nCode Block 2: Heatmap for visualizing temperature anomalies\n\n# Plot the heatmap\nplt.figure(figsize=(15, 8))\nsns.heatmap(data, cmap=\"coolwarm\", linewidths=0.1)\nplt.title('Annual Temperature Anomalies Heatmap over each Latitude Range')\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Latitude Range')\n\n# Define a function to highlight certain years in red\ndef highlight_years(ax, years_to_highlight):\n    for label in ax.get_xticklabels():\n        if label.get_text() in years_to_highlight:\n            label.set_color('red')\n\n# Apply the highlight function to the x-tick labels\nhighlight_years(plt.gca(), ['1950', '1955', '1960', '1965', '1970', '1975', '1980'])\n\nplt.show()\n\n\nCode Block 3: Time series analysis\n# Time series plot of global-mean monthly temperature anomalies\n\n# Load the global-mean monthly data, will add path\nglobal_mean_data = pd.read_csv('path_to_global_mean_data.csv')\n\n# Convert the 'Year' column to datetime type\nglobal_mean_data['Year'] = pd.to_datetime(global_mean_data['Year'], format='%Y')\n\n# Set the 'Year' column as the index\nglobal_mean_data.set_index('Year', inplace=True)\n\n# Plot the global-mean monthly temperature data\nplt.figure(figsize=(15, 5))\nplt.plot(global_mean_data.index, global_mean_data['Global_mean_temp'], label='Global Mean Temp')\n\n# Add trend line using rolling average or polynomial fitting\n\nrolling_mean = global_mean_data['Global_mean_temp'].rolling(window=10).mean()\nplt.plot(global_mean_data.index, rolling_mean, label='10-year Rolling Mean', color='red')\n\nplt.title('Time Series of Global Mean Monthly Temperature Anomalies')\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Temperature Anomaly (°C)')\nplt.legend()\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe heatmap visualization elucidates the distribution and intensity of temperature anomalies across different latitudinal ranges. Notably, there appears to be a concentration of higher anomalies (red tones) in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in the higher latitudes. This could indicate a stronger warming trend in these areas, which is consistent with the current understanding of climate change where polar and high-latitude regions are warming faster than the global average.\nFurthermore, the analysis of the global mean temperature anomalies over time reveals a clear upward trend, signifying an increase in global temperatures. This trend is likely influenced by anthropogenic factors, as suggested by the literature on global warming. The variations in anomalies also suggest periods of relative stability interspersed with rapid increases, potentially corresponding with known climatic events or changes in greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn conclusion, the data preprocessing and subsequent analysis have provided valuable insights into the historical patterns of temperature change. The evidence points to a planet that is experiencing significant warming, with pronounced effects at higher latitudes. Further investigation could focus on correlating these patterns with environmental and human activities to better understand the drivers behind these changes."

Latitudinal bands closer to the Arctic (64°N to 90°N) show more pronounced warming, a phenomenon known as polar amplification. Recent years across all latitudes are predominantly red, suggesting higher-than-average temperatures becoming the new normal. The reference years marked in red may denote the baseline for calculating anomalies, implying an increasing baseline temperature. Overall, the data illustrates the global extent of climate change, with the most significant changes occurring at the poles.\nThe heatmap visualization elucidates the distribution and intensity of temperature anomalies across different latitudinal ranges. Notably, there appears to be a concentration of higher anomalies (red tones) in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in the higher latitudes. This could indicate a stronger warming trend in these areas, which is consistent with the current understanding of climate change where polar and high-latitude regions are warming faster than the global average.\nFurthermore, the analysis of the global mean temperature anomalies over time reveals a clear upward trend, signifying an increase in global temperatures.

This would not only capture how seasonal temperatures have strayed from some long-term average, but how temperatures are fluctuating relative to even temporally local averages.\nApproach: We’ll perform comparative analysis by comparing 2023 average temperature anomalies with historical peaks, both globally and hemispherically, while also scrutinizing seasonal variations to deepen our understanding.\nAnalysis:\n\nimport pandas as pd \nimport numpy as np  \nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.ticker import MaxNLocator\n\n\nNH = pd.read_csv('./data/nh_temps.csv')\nSH = pd.read_csv('./data/sh_temps.csv')\n# SH = SH.set_index('Year')\n# NH = NH.set_index('Year')\n\n\nSH = SH.rename(columns={'DJF': \"JJA\", 'MAM': 'SON', 'JJA': \"DJF\", 'SON':'MAM' })\n\n\ndf_long = NH.melt(id_vars=['Year'], value_vars=['DJF', 'MAM', 'JJA', 'SON'], var_name='Season', value_name='Temperature')\n\n\n\ndf_long_SH = SH.melt(id_vars=['Year'], value_vars=['DJF', 'MAM', 'JJA', 'SON'], var_name='Season', value_name='Temperature')\n\ndf_long['Hemisphere'] = 'NH'\ndf_long_SH['Hemisphere'] = 'SH'\ndf_full = pd.concat([df_long, df_long_SH], ignore_index=True)\n# Convert 'Year' into a string so we can concatenate it with 'Season' for a unique x-axis label\n\ndf_full['Year'] = df_full['Year'].astype(str)\ndf_full['Time'] = df_full['Year'] + \" \" + df_full['Season']\ndf_full['Hue'] = df_full['Hemisphere'] + ' - ' + df_full['Season']\n\n\nnth_label = 10 \nseason = ['DJF', 'MAM', 'JJA', 'SON']\nseason_name = ['Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall']\nfigg, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=2, figsize=(20, 8))\nfor u, i in enumerate(season):\n    sub_full = df_full[df_full['Season']==i] \n\n    plot = sns.lineplot(data=sub_full, x='Year', y='Temperature', hue='Hue', marker='o', ax=ax.flatten()[u])\n\n# Setting the title and labels for the plot\n    ax.flatten()[u].set_title(f'Temperature Variations for {season_name[u]}', fontsize=20) # Adjust title font size as needed\n     # Increase font size for x label\n    ax.flatten()[u].set_ylabel('Temperature Variation (°C)', fontsize=13) # Increase font size for y label\n    ax.flatten()[u].tick_params(axis='y', labelsize=13)\n    if u &lt;=1 :\n        ax.flatten()[u].set_xticks([])\n        ax.flatten()[u].get_xaxis().set_visible(False)\n    else :\n        ax.flatten()[u].set_xlabel('Time', fontsize=13)\n\n# Change the x-tick labels to season names\n    ax.flatten()[u].legend(title='Legend', fontsize=13)\n    for index, label in enumerate(ax.flatten()[u].get_xticklabels()):\n        if index % nth_label != 0:\n            label.set_visible(False)\n\n\n\nfigg, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=1, figsize=(20, 8))\nplot = sns.boxplot(data=df_full, y='Temperature', x='Season', hue='Hemisphere', ax=ax)\n\n# Setting the title and labels for the plot\nax.set_title('Temperature Variations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres', fontsize=20) # Adjust title font size as needed\nax.set_xlabel('Season', fontsize=16) # Increase font size for x label\nax.set_ylabel('Temperature Variation (°C)', fontsize=16) # Increase font size for y label\n\n# Change the x-tick labels to season names\nax.set_xticklabels(['Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall'])\n\n# Increase font size of the tick labels\nax.tick_params(axis='x', labelsize=16)\nax.tick_params(axis='y', labelsize=16)\n\n# Add a legend to distinguish the seasons and hemispheres, adjust font size as needed\nax.legend(title='Legend', fontsize=15)\n\n# Optimize layout and show the plot\nfigg.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n/var/folders/wr/323h4t5x63zbc0d1jr1l1nlm0000gn/T/ipykernel_81880/1810613142.py:57: UserWarning: set_ticklabels() should only be used with a fixed number of ticks, i.e. after set_ticks() or using a FixedLocator.\n  ax.set_xticklabels(['Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall'])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion: Across all graphs, there’s a noticeable increase in temperature variation, particularly from around the 1970s onwards, reflecting a trend towards warming in both hemispheres. This warming trend appears more pronounced during the Winter and Spring seasons. The data indicates some volatility in temperature changes year on year, but the overall trajectory suggests a significant rise in global temperatures, consistent with patterns of climate change.\nThe boxplot summarizes temperature variations across seasons in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, revealing subtle yet insightful differences. In the Northern Hemisphere, a greater variability in winter temperatures is apparent, suggested by longer whiskers and more outliers, likely influenced by its extensive landmass. Spring shows a slightly higher median temperature variation in the Northern Hemisphere, indicative of consistently warmer springs than in the Southern Hemisphere. Interestingly, during summer, the two hemispheres display nearly identical temperature variations, suggesting a universal pattern of summer temperature changes. Come fall, the Southern Hemisphere exhibits a slightly wider range of temperature variations, which could point towards a more dynamic climatic response during this season.\nOverall, while median temperature variations are generally comparable between the hemispheres, the Northern Hemisphere tends to exhibit greater extremes, particularly in winter and spring, which can be attributed to its larger landmass and consequent continental climate influence."
