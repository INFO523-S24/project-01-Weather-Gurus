Initially, we should transform the data from a wide format to a long format by defining a new column called zones and merging all eight variables related to zones (i.e. 24N-44N, …) to that column. As we are focusing on annual zonal anomalies in this qustion, we can skip Glob, NHem, and SHem variables. Finally, we would have a dataframe with three columns with one represnting year, one represnting zone and the last contains the annomalies. We can create time series for each zone to visualize the pattern of zonal annual temperature anomalies, emphasizing any noticeable trends or deviation from zonal long-term mean anomaly. Also, we can employ heatmaps to map the variance of the zonal annual temperature anomaly on top of countries and oceans boundaries to show which hemisphere behaves more erratically.\nWe should use nh_temps.csv and sh_temps.csv datasets. We should start by converting the dataset of each hemispheres to a long format by defining one new column for month (season) and one column that shows the hemispheres (NH and SH). Finally, we can merge the dataframes vertically to arrive at a one comprehensive dataframe. We can compare the pattern of seasonal temperature anomalies over the Northern and Southern hemispheres separately and collectively. We can use time series, box plots, or histograms to illustrate and compare the time series and statistical distribution of seasonal temperature anomalies in the northern and southern hemispheres to discuss how different and similar they are. It may be interesting to create a similar visualization to the previous question with deviation from long-term anomalies. This would not only capture how seasonal temperatures have strayed from some long-term average, but how temperatures are fluctuating relative to even temporally local averages"

    "text": "Question 1: How have zonal annual temperatures changed over the years? Can we detect any latitudinal pattern? When was the hottest year on record?\nIntroduction: Introduction: We used variables inside the zonnan_temps.csv dataset. Initially, we transformed the data from a wide format to a long format by defining a new column called zones and merging all eight variables related to zones (i.e. 24N-44N, …) to that column. As we are focusing on annual zonal anomalies in this question, we can skip Glob, NHem, and SHem variables. Finally, we have a dataframe with three columns representing year, zone, and the last contains the anomalies. We created a time series for each zone to visualize the pattern of zonal annual temperature anomalies, emphasizing any noticeable trends or deviation from zonal long-term mean anomaly. We used heatmaps to illustrate how zonal annual temperature anomalies vary across countries and oceans, revealing which hemisphere exhibits more erratic behavior.\nApproach: The approach for this analysis will involve two distinct methods: heatmap visualization and time series analysis. The heatmap provides an intuitive grasp of the data by color mapping the temperature anomalies across latitudinal zones over time. This method is suitable for spotting overall trends and outliers in a comprehensive visual format. For the time series analysis, we will examine the changes in global and hemispheric mean temperatures over time. This will involve plotting the data, with a particular emphasis on trend lines to discern long-term changes. The use of color mapping in the heatmap serves to quickly convey the magnitude of anomalies, while the time series plot with its trend line will enable us to evaluate the trajectory of temperature changes more formally.\n\nCode Block 1: Load and preprocess the data\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport joypy\nfrom matplotlib import cm\n\nzonann_temps = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-07-11/zonann_temps.csv')\n\n# Step 1: Convert the DataFrame from wide to long format\ndata = pd.melt(zonann_temps, id_vars = ['Year', 'Glob'], \n                       value_vars = ['EQU-24N', '24N-44N', '44N-64N', '64N-90N', '24S-EQU', '44S-24S', '64S-44S', '90S-64S'],\n                       var_name = 'lat_range', value_name = 'temp_dev')\n\n\n# Pivot the data for heatmap plotting, with Year on the x-axis and latitude ranges on the y-axis\nheatmap_data_swapped_axes = data.pivot(\"lat_range\", \"Year\", \"temp_dev\")\n\n\n\nCode Block 2: Heatmap for visualizing temperature anomalies\n\n# Define the specified order for latitude ranges\nlat_range_order = ['64N-90N', '44N-64N', '24N-44N', 'EQU-24N', '24S-EQU', '44S-24S', '64S-44S', '90S-64S']\n\n# Reorder the dataframe according to the specified latitude range order\nheatmap_data_ordered = heatmap_data_swapped_axes.reindex(lat_range_order)\n\n# Plot the heatmap\nplt.figure(figsize = (12, 8))\nsns.heatmap(heatmap_data_ordered, cmap = \"coolwarm\", linewidths = 0.1)\nplt.title('Annual Temperature Annomalies Heatmap over each Latitude Range \\nYears Colored in Red on the x Axis Show Reference Years')\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Latitude Range')\n\n# Set x-tick labels to appear every five years and color reference years in red\nyears = heatmap_data_ordered.columns.values\nticks = range(0, len(years), 5)  # Show a tick every 5 years\nplt.xticks(ticks, [years[i] for i in ticks], rotation = 45)\nhighlight_years = ['1950', '1955', '1960', '1965', '1970', '1975', '1980']\nfor label in plt.gca().get_xticklabels():\n    if label.get_text() in highlight_years:\n        label.set_color('red')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Block 3: Ridgeplots of zonnal temperature annomalies\n\n# Define the desired order for the latitude ranges\nlat_order = ['64N-90N', '44N-64N', '24N-44N', 'EQU-24N', '24S-EQU', '44S-24S', '64S-44S', '90S-64S']\n\n# Ensure that the 'lat_range' column is of categorical type and set the categories and their order\ndata['lat_range'] = pd.Categorical(data['lat_range'], categories=lat_order, ordered=True)\n\n# Create the ridgeline plot with the specified order\nfig, axes = joypy.joyplot(\n    data=data, \n    by='lat_range', \n    column='temp_dev',\n    colormap=cm.viridis, \n    figsize=(12, 8),\n    alpha=0.6,\n    linewidth=1\n)\n\nplt.title('Ridgeline Plot of Temperature Deviations by Latitude Range', fontsize=14, pad=0)\nplt.xlabel('Temperature Annomaly')\nplt.xlim(-3, 3)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion: The heatmap visualization elucidates the distribution and intensity of temperature anomalies across different latitudinal ranges. Notably, there appears to be a concentration of higher anomalies (red tones) in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in the higher latitudes. This could indicate a stronger warming trend in these areas, which is consistent with the current understanding of climate change where polar and high-latitude regions are warming faster than the global average.\nFurthermore, the analysis of the global mean temperature anomalies over time reveals a clear upward trend, signifying an increase in global temperatures. This trend is likely influenced by anthropogenic factors, as suggested by the literature on global warming. The variations in anomalies also suggest periods of relative stability interspersed with rapid increases, potentially corresponding with known climatic events or changes in greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn conclusion, the data preprocessing and subsequent analysis have provided valuable insights into the historical patterns of temperature change. The evidence points to a planet that is experiencing significant warming, with pronounced effects at higher latitudes. Further investigation could focus on correlating these patterns with environmental and human activities to better understand the drivers behind these changes."

    "text": "Title\n\n\nIntroduction to Question 1\nThis part investigates the historical trends in temperature anomalies across various latitudinal zones from 1880 to the present, utilizing the GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP v4) dataset. The analysis focuses on the deviation of temperatures from the 1951-1980 mean, offering insights into climate behavior over time. Our interest lies in understanding how temperature variations are distributed across the planet and discerning patterns that could indicate broader climate trends. By examining both hemispheres and various latitudinal zones, we aim to reveal differential impacts of climate change across the globe. This analysis is particularly pertinent given the growing concerns regarding global warming and its disparate effects on different regions of the Earth.\n\n\nApproach\nThe approach for this analysis will involve two distinct methods: heatmap visualization and time series analysis. The heatmap provides an intuitive grasp of the data by color mapping the temperature anomalies across latitudinal zones over time. This method is suitable for spotting overall trends and outliers in a comprehensive visual format. For the time series analysis, we will examine the changes in global and hemispheric mean temperatures over time. This will involve plotting the data, with a particular emphasis on trend lines to discern long-term changes. The use of color mapping in the heatmap serves to quickly convey the magnitude of anomalies, while the time series plot with its trend line will enable us to evaluate the trajectory of temperature changes more formally.\n\n\nAnalysis\nBelow are just template for us to structure our code blocks for the Analysis section.\n\n\nCode Block 1: Load and preprocess the data\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Load the dataset, will add path \ndata = pd.read_csv('')\n\n# Data preprocessing steps\n\ndata.fillna(data.mean(), inplace=True)\n\n\nCode Block 2: Heatmap for visualizing temperature anomalies\n\n# Plot the heatmap\nplt.figure(figsize=(15, 8))\nsns.heatmap(data, cmap=\"coolwarm\", linewidths=0.1)\nplt.title('Annual Temperature Anomalies Heatmap over each Latitude Range')\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Latitude Range')\n\n# Define a function to highlight certain years in red\ndef highlight_years(ax, years_to_highlight):\n    for label in ax.get_xticklabels():\n        if label.get_text() in years_to_highlight:\n            label.set_color('red')\n\n# Apply the highlight function to the x-tick labels\nhighlight_years(plt.gca(), ['1950', '1955', '1960', '1965', '1970', '1975', '1980'])\n\nplt.show()\n\n\nCode Block 3: Time series analysis\n# Time series plot of global-mean monthly temperature anomalies\n\n# Load the global-mean monthly data, will add path\nglobal_mean_data = pd.read_csv('path_to_global_mean_data.csv')\n\n# Convert the 'Year' column to datetime type\nglobal_mean_data['Year'] = pd.to_datetime(global_mean_data['Year'], format='%Y')\n\n# Set the 'Year' column as the index\nglobal_mean_data.set_index('Year', inplace=True)\n\n# Plot the global-mean monthly temperature data\nplt.figure(figsize=(15, 5))\nplt.plot(global_mean_data.index, global_mean_data['Global_mean_temp'], label='Global Mean Temp')\n\n# Add trend line using rolling average or polynomial fitting\n\nrolling_mean = global_mean_data['Global_mean_temp'].rolling(window=10).mean()\nplt.plot(global_mean_data.index, rolling_mean, label='10-year Rolling Mean', color='red')\n\nplt.title('Time Series of Global Mean Monthly Temperature Anomalies')\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Temperature Anomaly (°C)')\nplt.legend()\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe heatmap visualization elucidates the distribution and intensity of temperature anomalies across different latitudinal ranges. Notably, there appears to be a concentration of higher anomalies (red tones) in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in the higher latitudes. This could indicate a stronger warming trend in these areas, which is consistent with the current understanding of climate change where polar and high-latitude regions are warming faster than the global average.\nFurthermore, the analysis of the global mean temperature anomalies over time reveals a clear upward trend, signifying an increase in global temperatures. This trend is likely influenced by anthropogenic factors, as suggested by the literature on global warming. The variations in anomalies also suggest periods of relative stability interspersed with rapid increases, potentially corresponding with known climatic events or changes in greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn conclusion, the data preprocessing and subsequent analysis have provided valuable insights into the historical patterns of temperature change. The evidence points to a planet that is experiencing significant warming, with pronounced effects at higher latitudes. Further investigation could focus on correlating these patterns with environmental and human activities to better understand the drivers behind these changes."
