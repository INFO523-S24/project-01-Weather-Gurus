### Title



### Introduction to Question 1
This part investigates the historical trends in temperature anomalies across various latitudinal zones from 1880 to the present, utilizing the GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP v4) dataset. The analysis focuses on the deviation of temperatures from the 1951-1980 mean, offering insights into climate behavior over time. Our interest lies in understanding how temperature variations are distributed across the planet and discerning patterns that could indicate broader climate trends. By examining both hemispheres and various latitudinal zones, we aim to reveal differential impacts of climate change across the globe. This analysis is particularly pertinent given the growing concerns regarding global warming and its disparate effects on different regions of the Earth.

### Approach
The approach for this analysis will involve two distinct methods: heatmap visualization and time series analysis. The heatmap provides an intuitive grasp of the data by color mapping the temperature anomalies across latitudinal zones over time. This method is suitable for spotting overall trends and outliers in a comprehensive visual format. For the time series analysis, we will examine the changes in global and hemispheric mean temperatures over time. This will involve plotting the data, with a particular emphasis on trend lines to discern long-term changes. The use of color mapping in the heatmap serves to quickly convey the magnitude of anomalies, while the time series plot with its trend line will enable us to evaluate the trajectory of temperature changes more formally.

### Analysis

Below are just template for us to structure our code blocks for the Analysis section.

### Code Block 1: Load and preprocess the data

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset, will add path 
data = pd.read_csv('')

# Data preprocessing steps

data.fillna(data.mean(), inplace=True)

```

### Code Block 2: Heatmap for visualizing temperature anomalies

```python

# Plot the heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 8))
sns.heatmap(data, cmap="coolwarm", linewidths=0.1)
plt.title('Annual Temperature Anomalies Heatmap over each Latitude Range')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Latitude Range')

# Define a function to highlight certain years in red
def highlight_years(ax, years_to_highlight):
    for label in ax.get_xticklabels():
        if label.get_text() in years_to_highlight:
            label.set_color('red')

# Apply the highlight function to the x-tick labels
highlight_years(plt.gca(), ['1950', '1955', '1960', '1965', '1970', '1975', '1980'])

plt.show()

```

### Code Block 3: Time series analysis

```python
# Time series plot of global-mean monthly temperature anomalies

# Load the global-mean monthly data, will add path
global_mean_data = pd.read_csv('path_to_global_mean_data.csv')

# Convert the 'Year' column to datetime type
global_mean_data['Year'] = pd.to_datetime(global_mean_data['Year'], format='%Y')

# Set the 'Year' column as the index
global_mean_data.set_index('Year', inplace=True)

# Plot the global-mean monthly temperature data
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 5))
plt.plot(global_mean_data.index, global_mean_data['Global_mean_temp'], label='Global Mean Temp')

# Add trend line using rolling average or polynomial fitting

rolling_mean = global_mean_data['Global_mean_temp'].rolling(window=10).mean()
plt.plot(global_mean_data.index, rolling_mean, label='10-year Rolling Mean', color='red')

plt.title('Time Series of Global Mean Monthly Temperature Anomalies')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Temperature Anomaly (Â°C)')
plt.legend()

```


### Discussion
The heatmap visualization elucidates the distribution and intensity of temperature anomalies across different latitudinal ranges. Notably, there appears to be a concentration of higher anomalies (red tones) in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in the higher latitudes. This could indicate a stronger warming trend in these areas, which is consistent with the current understanding of climate change where polar and high-latitude regions are warming faster than the global average.

Furthermore, the analysis of the global mean temperature anomalies over time reveals a clear upward trend, signifying an increase in global temperatures. This trend is likely influenced by anthropogenic factors, as suggested by the literature on global warming. The variations in anomalies also suggest periods of relative stability interspersed with rapid increases, potentially corresponding with known climatic events or changes in greenhouse gas emissions.

In conclusion, the data preprocessing and subsequent analysis have provided valuable insights into the historical patterns of temperature change. The evidence points to a planet that is experiencing significant warming, with pronounced effects at higher latitudes. Further investigation could focus on correlating these patterns with environmental and human activities to better understand the drivers behind these changes.
