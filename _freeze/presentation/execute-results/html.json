We'll analyze yearly temperature anomalies using the J-D column from global_temps.csv, nh_temps.csv, and sh_temps.csv datasets to assess global and hemispheric trends. \n\n-   Additionally, we'll focus on seasonal anomalies, examining DJF and JJA for the Northern Hemisphere and their inverted counterparts for the Southern Hemisphere. To enrich our analysis, we'll integrate 2023 temperature anomaly data from NASA's GISS Surface Temperature Analysis, calculating both yearly and seasonal anomalies for that year.\n\n## Question 1\n\n\n\n## Code & Visualizations \n\n\n## Question 2\n\n## Code & Visualization \n\n",
